"""Run the secrets guards the way a commit hook runs them.

git hands its own environment to the hooks it starts, and the variable that
matters is ``GIT_DIR``: once it is set, a git subprocess stops searching for
the repository and trusts the variable instead. In a worktree that value is an
absolute path into the main checkout, so it keeps pointing at a repository from
any directory at all.

Both secrets guards used to let that variable steer the git they called, and
both answered about the wrong directory because of it. The baseline audit asked
``git rev-parse --show-toplevel`` for the repo root and was told ``tests/``, so
it reported ``.secrets.baseline`` missing. The suppression gate ran
``git ls-files`` in an empty temporary directory to prove it fails outside a
repository, and the inherited value led it back to the real one, so it never
failed. Neither showed up in a plain ``pytest`` run -- only at ``git commit``,
where they blocked every commit made from a worktree.

This gate re-runs both guards in a subprocess carrying that environment, so the
next guard that reaches for git without accounting for it fails here, in the
suite, rather than in front of whoever tries to commit next. It sets ``GIT_DIR``
to an absolute path whatever the checkout, so a plain clone exercises the same
condition a worktree does.
