"""Unit tests for the pure helpers in scripts/template_setup/cleanup.py.

The template_setup folder is not a package, so the module is imported by
adding the folder to sys.path, mirroring how the setup scripts import their
shared _common module.

This file is itself a dev-script test: cleanup.py matches it to
scripts/template_setup/cleanup.py and deletes it along with the rest of the
scaffolding, so it never lingers in a project started from the template.
