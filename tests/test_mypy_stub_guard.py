"""Guard against mypy config that silences imports with published type stubs.

When mypy reports 'Library stubs not installed for "X"', the correct fix is to
install the stub package it names (e.g. types-tabulate), not to silence the
module in pyproject.toml. This test reads the [tool.mypy] config and fails if
any silencing mechanism covers a module whose stubs are published on PyPI. It
consults mypy.stubinfo, the same registry mypy uses to print those hints, so
it works offline and stays in sync with the installed mypy version.

Caveat: mypy.stubinfo is internal to mypy, not a public API. The canary test
below fails loudly if an upgrade changes its behavior; if that happens, update
this module to the new API instead of deleting the guard.
