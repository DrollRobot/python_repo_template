"""Run detect-secrets' pre-commit hook with file paths in the local OS style.

detect-secrets 1.5.0 converts every path it scans, and every path it loads from
the baseline, to the local separator -- backslashes on Windows. The list of
files the hook was handed is the one thing it leaves alone, and the hook uses
that list to drop baseline entries for files that no longer contain any
secrets. pre-commit and ``git ls-files`` pass forward slashes, so on Windows
that list never matches the baseline and those entries are never dropped. The
hook passes, the stale entries get committed, and CI on Linux -- where the
conversion changes nothing -- drops them, rewrites the baseline and fails.

This wrapper converts each argument that names an existing file the same way
detect-secrets converts the rest, then hands off to the real hook, so a commit
on Windows updates the baseline exactly as CI would.

Usage (as the pre-commit entry; pre-commit appends the staged files):
    uv run python tests/detect_secrets_hook.py --baseline .secrets.baseline
