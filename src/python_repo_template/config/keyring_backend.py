"""OS-keyring credential backend.

Stores secrets in the OS-native credential store: Windows Credential Manager,
macOS Keychain, or Linux Secret Service (GNOME Keyring / KWallet). Selected
by ``credential_backend = "keyring"`` in a profile. Secrets are namespaced
per profile via the keyring *service* (``python_repo_template:<profile>``);
the *username* slot holds the secret's storage name.

The ``keyring`` package is an optional dependency (the ``keyring`` extra) and
is imported lazily, so this module is importable — and the rest of the config
system fully usable — without it installed.

The *username* slot holds the secret's storage name: the schema field name by
default, or the profile's ``<field>_secret_name`` override (resolved by the
dispatcher before this module is called).

Headless hosts (Linux without D-Bus/SecretService, containers, CI) have no
usable keyring; ``keyring`` then selects a fail/null backend. That is
detected on first use and raised as an actionable error naming the
alternatives -- this backend never falls back to writing plaintext anywhere.

To remove the keyring backend entirely: delete this file and its test module
``tests/test_keyring_backend.py``, and delete the ``keyring`` extra in
``pyproject.toml``'s ``[project.optional-dependencies]`` (then run
``uv lock`` and ``uv sync --all-extras``). With this file gone there are no
``keyring`` imports anywhere, and profiles must select another backend.
