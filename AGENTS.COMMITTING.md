# Rules for Commit messages

- We should never be doing active work in the main branch. If we're in the main
   branch, take no action. Alert the user.

- Commit messages should follow Conventional Commits format:
   https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
   And qoomon's commit message style guide:
   https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13
   Fetch both pages at least once every session. Do not rely on memory alone.

- After committing, if we're in a non-main branch, always push to origin of
   the current branch.
