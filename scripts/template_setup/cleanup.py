"""Remove the template-setup scaffolding once you are done with it.

After you have renamed the project, stripped the headers, chosen a license, and
worked through the FIXMEs, these setup scripts have served their purpose. This
script deletes them (the whole ``scripts/template_setup/`` folder, including
itself), the unit tests for the dev scripts and Claude Code hooks (the
scripts and hooks themselves stay -- their tests only matter while developing
the template), and any leftover
``LICENSE.*.FIXME`` candidates -- but only once a real ``LICENSE`` file
exists, so you are never left with no license.

It also trims the pyproject.toml lines that only matter while developing the
template itself: the ``--cov=scripts`` coverage flag (the dev-script tests are
deleted here, so scripts coverage would read as untested), the
``scripts/template_setup`` entry in mypy's search path (that folder is gone),
and ``scripts``/``.claude/hooks`` from mypy's ``files``. The scripts and hooks
themselves stay -- but they are the template's code, not the project's, so a
downstream project should not have its type check fail on them. Run mypy on
them by path (``uv run mypy scripts``) if you do edit them.

It does NOT edit prose for you; it prints reminders for the manual bits (such as
working through the FIXMEs left in the project's own files).

Usage:
    uv run scripts/template_setup/cleanup.py
    uv run scripts/template_setup/cleanup.py --dry-run
