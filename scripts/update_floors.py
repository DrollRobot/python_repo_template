"""Raise every direct dependency's lower-version bound to the latest allowed.

For each dependency declared in ``[project.dependencies]`` and every
``[dependency-groups]`` table, this sets the ``>=`` floor to the newest version
the project's existing upper bounds already permit, sourced from ``uv.lock``.

The flow is index-aware and cap-respecting by design:

  1. ``uv lock --upgrade`` resolves the latest version of every dependency that
     still satisfies the bounds in pyproject.toml (honoring the configured index,
     ``exclude-newer``, and any ``[tool.uv]`` constraints).
  2. Each direct dependency's ``>=`` floor is raised to its locked version.
  3. ``uv tree --outdated`` reports anything a *newer major* still holds back.

Floors are only ever raised to a version the current upper bound allows, so the
result is never an unsatisfiable constraint. Crossing an upper bound (a new
major) is deliberately left as a manual decision -- see AGENTS.RELEASING.md --
and is only reported here, never applied. Upper bounds, extras, environment
markers, and every comment in pyproject.toml are preserved untouched.

Not modified: dependencies without a ``>=`` floor (e.g. an unpinned name or an
exact ``==`` pin), dependencies absent from uv.lock (marker-gated backports or
git/path sources), and ``[tool.uv] constraint-dependencies`` (security pins,
managed by hand per the releasing doc).

Usage:
    uv run scripts/update_floors.py
    uv run scripts/update_floors.py --dry-run     # preview from the current lock
    uv run scripts/update_floors.py --no-lock     # skip 'uv lock'; use the lock as-is
    uv run scripts/update_floors.py -y            # answer every prompt with 'yes'

Requirements:
    - Run from anywhere inside the project (the root is found automatically).
    - ``uv`` installed and the project managed with uv.
