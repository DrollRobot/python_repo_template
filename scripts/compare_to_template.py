"""Compare a project's baseline files against the template it was created from.

A project generated from this template keeps a set of "baseline" files that
should track the template as it evolves: the GitHub workflows and templates,
the dev helper scripts, the AGENTS docs, lint/format config, and so on. This
script compares those files between a template checkout and the project,
replaying the mechanical transformations the template-setup scripts performed
so that only real drift is reported:

  - the template's snake_case / kebab-case project name -> the project's names
  - the template author's GitHub username -> the project's (from `git remote`)
  - the "TEMPLATE SETUP NOTES" banner comments -> stripped from both sides
  - the pinned Python version -> the project's (from `.python-version`)
  - the template-only pyproject.toml config -> dropped, as cleanup.py does
  - the commented-out private-repo-deps workflow steps -> stripped, as
    remove_private_repo_deps.py does, when the project declined them
  - AGENTS.md's "Package Purpose" section -> stripped from both sides, since
    every project fills it in with its own description

Each baseline file is strict (drift is an error) or lenient (expected to
diverge; reported for review only), and required or optional (optional
features such as mkdocs may be deleted from a
project). A few files (e.g. the README and the remote-disposability stub
pair) are checked for existence only, as the project rewrites their contents
wholesale. Files the project adds on top of the template are ignored.

Files belonging to a config-driven optional feature (mkdocs, the config
system and its credential backends, the remote-disposability scripts,
SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, the Claude Code command hooks) are gated on
that project's own choices, read from ``scripts/template_setup.toml``. When that file
is missing the script offers to copy the template's own over verbatim and
exits so it can be filled in; an unparsable file, or one whose ``[project]``
name is still the template's (the file was never filled in, so its flags
cannot be trusted), is a hard error -- never a cue to guess. A feature the
project declined is left out of the comparison, the version preflight, and
``--diff`` entirely: it is never reported and never offered for copy, exactly
like a file the project simply doesn't have. A feature the project kept is
compared like any other required file, so an accidentally deleted one is
reported as drift instead of silently ignored. The private-repo-deps feature
is different: it is not a ``gate`` on any file (ci.yml/audit.yml/docs.yml
stay required and strict either way) -- instead its commented-out steps are
replayed away from the template side before comparing, per
``replay_private_repo_deps()``.

Before anything else -- reading ``template_setup.toml`` included -- the script checks
its own copy and its ``_cli`` module against the template and offers to copy
either over when out of date, stopping for a re-run if the executing copy
was replaced; a project whose config is missing or unfilled still gets the
current script first, whose setup handling may be the very thing that
changed. Then, before comparing, it checks the version of every other
versioned file (the dev helper scripts ``scripts/*.py`` and the ``mypy``
stub-guard test, minus the existence-only ones) on both sides and offers to
copy over any that are out of date or missing in the project, so those files
-- and the manifest and replay logic this script compares against -- match
the template's current ones. After comparing, any other required file found missing is also
offered for install. Every install writes the template's *normalized* text
(banner stripped, names/version/cleanup replayed), so a freshly installed
file compares as a match; ``--no-update`` suppresses every offer.

Run it from either repository; the other repository is given as the
positional path (default: a sibling folder with the template's name):

    uv run scripts/compare_to_template.py
    uv run scripts/compare_to_template.py C:/dev/TEMPLATE-CLONE
    uv run scripts/compare_to_template.py --diff        # open diffs in VS Code
    uv run scripts/compare_to_template.py --all         # also list matching files
    uv run scripts/compare_to_template.py --no-update   # CI: never write anything

Exit codes: 0 = no drift (lenient "review" differences allowed), 1 = drift
found (a strict file differs or a required file is missing) or a fatal error.
