"""Compare a project's baseline files against the template it was created from.

A project generated from this template keeps a set of "baseline" files that
should track the template as it evolves: the GitHub workflows and templates,
the dev helper scripts, the AGENTS docs, lint/format config, and so on. This
script compares those files between a template checkout and the project,
replaying the mechanical transformations the template-setup scripts performed
so that only real drift is reported:

  - the template's snake_case / kebab-case project name -> the project's names
  - the template author's GitHub username -> the project's (from `git remote`)
  - the "TEMPLATE SETUP NOTES" banner comments -> stripped from both sides
  - the pinned Python version -> the project's (from `.python-version`)
  - the template-only pyproject.toml config -> dropped, as cleanup.py does

Each baseline file is strict (drift is an error) or lenient (expected to
diverge; reported for review only), and required or optional (optional
features such as mkdocs or the credential helpers may be deleted from a
project). A few files (e.g. the README) are checked for existence only, as
the project rewrites their contents wholesale. Files the project adds on top
of the template are ignored.

Files belonging to a config-driven optional feature (mkdocs, the keyring/
KeyVault credential backends, the Claude Code command hooks) are gated on
that project's own choices, read from ``scripts/setup.toml`` -- or, if that
file is missing, inferred from which feature files exist. A feature the
project declined is left out of the comparison, the version preflight, and
``--diff`` entirely: it is never reported and never offered for copy, exactly
like a file the project simply doesn't have. A feature the project kept is
compared like any other required file, so an accidentally deleted one is
reported as drift instead of silently ignored.

Before comparing, the script checks the version of every versioned file (the
dev helper scripts ``scripts/*.py`` and the ``mypy`` stub-guard test) on both
sides and offers to copy over any that are out of date or missing in the
project, so those files -- and the manifest and replay logic this script
compares against -- match the template's current ones.

Run it from either repository; the other repository is given as the
positional path (default: a sibling folder with the template's name):

    uv run scripts/compare_to_template.py
    uv run scripts/compare_to_template.py C:/dev/TEMPLATE-CLONE
    uv run scripts/compare_to_template.py --diff        # open diffs in VS Code
    uv run scripts/compare_to_template.py --all         # also list matching files
    uv run scripts/compare_to_template.py --no-update   # CI: never write anything

Exit codes: 0 = no drift (lenient "review" differences allowed), 1 = drift
found (a strict file differs or a required file is missing) or a fatal error.
