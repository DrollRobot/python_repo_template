.SYNOPSIS
    Interactively delete a finished git worktree created by New-Worktree.ps1.

.DESCRIPTION
    The inverse of New-Worktree.ps1, and the final step of the worktree
    lifecycle:

        New-Worktree  ->  (work, commit, Complete-WorkTree)  ->  Remove-WorkTree

    Run this once the work is done: the PR opened from the worktree's 'wt/<slug>'
    branch has been merged into develop and the worktree is no longer needed.

    WARNING: this permanently deletes the worktree directory and its local
    branch. It walks through the teardown one step at a time, showing what is
    about to happen and prompting for confirmation (y/n) before each action;
    answering 'n' stops without taking the remaining steps. The output of every
    git command is shown.

    Steps:
      1. Refresh develop  - git switch develop (if needed) + git pull --ff-only origin develop
      2. Remove worktree  - git worktree remove --force <path>
      3. Delete branch    - git branch -D wt/<slug>
      4. Prune stale refs - git fetch --prune

    Paths and names are derived exactly as New-Worktree.ps1 derives them, so the
    same slug that created a worktree will clean it up. Every step runs against
    the main worktree, so this is safe to run even from inside the worktree
    being removed (git refuses to remove the worktree you are standing in).

.PARAMETER Slug
    The same slug passed to New-Worktree.ps1 (e.g. "issue-42" or "fix/login").

.PARAMETER Base
    Integration branch to refresh and that the PR was merged into. Defaults to
    $env:WT_BASE, then "develop".

.EXAMPLE
    .\Remove-WorkTree.ps1 issue-42

.EXAMPLE
    .\Remove-WorkTree.ps1 fix/login

.NOTES
    Requirements:
      - PowerShell 7.4 or later.
      - The PR for 'wt/<slug>' has already been merged into develop.

    Env overrides mirror New-Worktree.ps1: WT_HOME (parent dir for worktrees),
    WT_PREFIX (branch prefix, default "wt/").
